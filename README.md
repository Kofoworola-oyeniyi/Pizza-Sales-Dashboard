### Project Overview
For a pizza restaurant chain, understanding sales performance, customer preferences, and product popularity is essential for maximizing revenue and optimizing menu offerings. In this project, I analysed sales data across multiple dimensions including revenue, order volume, pizza categories, sizes, and time-based trends to identify best and worst performing products, peak business periods, and customer purchasing patterns.

### Data Sources
The primary dataset used for this analysis contains pizza sales transaction records from the year 2015, including order details: pizza types, categories, sizes, quantities, and revenue figures across 21,350 total orders.

### Tools
- **SQL** - Exploratory Data Analysis
- **Power BI** - Data Visualization and Dashboard Design

### Data Cleaning and Preparation
In the data preparation phase, I performed the following tasks;
- Data loading and inspection
- Handling missing values and errors
- Data formatting and normalization
- Creating calculated measures (Total Revenue, Avg Order Value,Total Pizzas Sold, Avg Pizzas per Order)
- Categorizing pizzas by type, size, and category

2.Monthly Trend for Total Orders
3.Percentage of Sales by Pizza Category
4.Percentage of Sales by Pizza Size
5.Total Pizzas Sold by Pizza Category
6.Top 5 Best Sellers by Revenue, Total Quantity and Total Orders

### Results/Findings
Some of the Analysis results are summarised as follows;
- **The Thai Chicken** pizza generates the highest revenue, while **The Brie Carre** pizza records the lowest revenue, quantity sold, and total orders.
- **The Classic Deluxe** pizza leads in both purchase quantity and total order frequency.
- **Large size** pizzas generate the highest sales, contributing significantly to overall revenue.
- **Classic category** pizzas record the highest overall sales volume among all categories.
- Weekend days **(Friday and Saturday)** see the highest order volumes, indicating peak customer traffic.
- **July and May** are the peak months for pizza orders, suggesting seasonal demand patterns.
- The **Chicken category** leads in revenue contribution at 26.91%, closely followed by Supreme and Classic categories.
- **Medium sized** pizzas account for the largest revenue share.

### Recommendations
- **Promote top performers** — Feature The Thai Chicken and The Classic Deluxe in promotions and bundle offers to capitalize on their popularity.
- **Re-evaluate low performers** — Consider removing or reformulating The Brie Carre and other bottom-ranking pizzas to optimize menu efficiency.
- **Weekend-focused marketing** — Increase targeted campaigns and staffing on Fridays and Saturdays to maximize high-traffic periods.
- **Seasonal campaigns** — Launch summer promotions in July and May to align with peak ordering months.
- **Size-based pricing strategy** — Leverage the popularity of Large and Medium pizzas through value meal deals and upsizing incentives.
- **Category expansion** — Explore new offerings in the high-performing Chicken and Classic categories to drive further revenue growth.
